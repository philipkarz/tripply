# Tripply

*An app that helps users create itineraries for their vacations.*

Here at Sockaputa headquarters we attribute our success to us always taking a step back and asking ourselves how can we improve the world. And Tripply was born. Tripply is designed to help users create itineraries for their vacations. In additiont it is fully scalable. To begin a user clicks on "Sign Up" to create an account. Once signed in a user will be directed to thier profile page. They can then create a trip, by clicking "Plan Trip". After filling out the necessary trip details, you will be directed to the trip page where they can then create new activities for that trip. You are given the option of either creating your own activity, or use a Yelp API to suggest possible activities in your area. Your activities will be organized by date and time. Once you have filled out your itinerary you are on your way to a productive, exciting, well earned vacation. Happy travels!

## Unresolved Problems & Major Hurdles
- Working with API's was a challenge
- Creating, editing and deleting models through AJAX was more difficult
than we thought
- 



## Future Features
- A registered user should be able to search other APIs (in addition to Yelp), to populate activities, i.e. TripAdvisor
- A registered user should be able to decide whether or not they want their trip to be public
- When clicked into activity details, a user should be able to see a map of the location of the activity
- When clicked into a trip, a user should be able to see weather for the location/time period of the trip
- A user can rate their experience of the activities they do (1-5 stars)
- A user can copy another users trip/activity to their itinerary
- A user can upload pictures of thier dope trip

## Technical Requirements

Your **team** must:

- **Present the app at the end of the sprint** as a team.
- **Perform a team-wide retro** and at least one **code-review** after the completion of the sprint.

Your app must:

- Use **MongoDB & Express** to CRUD your data.
- **Produce a RESTful API that exposes at least one model**.
- **Consume its own API using AJAX if there's a single page application component to it.**
- **Authenticate users using at least one OAuth provider**.
